    "The dataset was downloaded from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Air+quality) and \"contains 9358 instances of hourly averaged responses from an array of 5 metal oxide chemical sensors embedded in an Air Quality Chemical Multisensor Device. The device was located on the field in a significantly polluted area, at road level, within an Italian city. Data were recorded from March 2004 to February 2005, for one year. Hourly averaged concentrations for CO, Non Metanic Hydrocarbons, Benzene, Total Nitrogen Oxides (NOx) and Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) were provided by a co-located reference certified analyzer.
