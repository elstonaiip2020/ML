Trying to run community analytics on network of this size (5000 nodes, 6500 edges) will take a very long time. I suggest reducing the size of this network by dropping nodes. You can do this by removing nodes with a low importance. I suggest removing nodes that are only connected to 3 or fewer nodes."
