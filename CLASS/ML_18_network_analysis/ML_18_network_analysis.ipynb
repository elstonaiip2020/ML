The network captures 34 members of a karate club, documenting 78 pairwise links between members who interacted outside the club. During the study a conflict arose between the administrator \"John A\" and instructor \"Mr. Hi\" (pseudonyms), which led to the split of the club into two. Half of the members formed a new club around Mr. Hi; members from the other part found a new instructor or gave up karate. Based on collected data Zachary correctly assigned all but one member of the club to the groups they actually joined after the split."
